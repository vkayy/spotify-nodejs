this web app analyses your listening based on patterns in musical features, extracted using the spotify api. moreover, based on the analysis, it curates a playlist of 100 songs which can automatically be added to your profile.

note that to use the app, you have to be manually verified by myself, due to spotify's developer policy.

in future, i plan to remake this with modernised frontend technology, i.e., react, next.js, etc.. then, i will apply to have the app launched officially for universal access under spotify's developer policy.

## motives

i love listening to music; i spend the majority of my day with a song playing. furthermore, seeking patterns and drawing predictions is another interest of mine.

so, i killed two birds with one stone, twisting both into one project. also, this was a fun way to familiarise myself with working with external APIs, and also designing my own RESTful API.
