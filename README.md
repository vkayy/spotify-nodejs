this web app analyses your listening based on patterns in musical features, extracted using the spotify api. moreover, based on the analysis, it curates a playlist of 100 songs which can automatically be added to your profile.

in future, i plan to remake this with a more modern frontend infrastructure and potentially apply to have the app launched officially for universal access under spotify's developer policy.

## instructions

if you would like to use the web app, please let me know! due to spotify's developer policy, users must be manually authorised on a non-published app.

if you are verified, then the usage is straightforward. click the button on the home screen, and you'll be redirected to a verification page.

after authenticating the web app to access your listening data, you'll be met with a carousel describing your quantified listening patterns, including loudness, wordiness, and other features.

then, an array of 100 songs will be collated, which can be cycled through using the forward and back buttons.

lastly, if you're interested in the songs, you can click on the playlist generation button to automatically add the playlist to your spotify account.

your playlist will have a randomly selected image of one of my favourite cats and the title 'recommended by vkay' :).

## motives

i love listening to music; i spend the majority of my day with a song playing. furthermore, seeking patterns and drawing predictions is another natural habit of mine.

so, i killed two birds with one stone, weaving both together in one project. also, this was a fun way to familiarise myself with working with external APIs, and also designing my own RESTful API.
